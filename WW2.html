            <h2> history</h2>
            <p>World War II (1939-1945) was a global conflict involving many of the world's nations. It started when Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany. Over time, the war expanded with Germany forming alliances with Italy and Japan, while the Allies, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, fought against them.</p>
            <p>The war saw large battles across Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. Germany's defeat came in 1945, after the Allies invaded France and the Soviet Union pushed into Germany. In the Pacific, Japan continued its aggression until the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, leading to Japan's surrender.</p>
